## 📋 Content & Messaging Audit

### Hero Section
**Current Headline**: "Career Centre"
**Problem**: Too generic, doesn't communicate value

**Suggested**: "Find Verified Construction Jobs & Gigs Across Kenya"

### Trust Strip
**Current**: 4 generic trust items
**Problem**: Doesn't differentiate from competitors

**Suggested Add**:
- "2,400+ workers trust us with KES 50M+ in earnings"
- "180+ verified employers"
- "650+ completed gigs this month"

### Featured Employers
**Current**: Just shows logos
**Problem**: Unclear purpose - are they hiring?

**Suggested**: Label as "Trusted Employers" or "Featured Hiring Partners"

### How It Works
**Current**: 3-step generic flow
**Problem**: Doesn't address pain points

**Suggested**: Show **specific benefits in each step**:
- "Create Profile" → "Get discovered by 180+ employers"
- "Browse & Apply" → "Apply to 50+ new jobs daily"
- "Get Hired & Earn" → "Secure payments within 24 hours"

## 🎨 Design & UX Issues

### 1. **CTA Hierarchy Unclear**
- Multiple buttons competing for attention
- No primary vs secondary distinction
- "Create Profile" button should be most prominent
- "Post a Job" should be secondary

### 2. **Missing Social Proof**
- No user testimonials visible
- No reviews/ratings prominently displayed
- No "recent activity" indicators
- No success metric callouts

### 3. **Search Functionality**
- Search form feels disconnected from main content
- No "trending searches" or suggestions
- Results unclear - where does clicking "Search" go?
- Insufficient field labels on mobile

### 4. **Missing Information Hierarchy**
- All sections equally weighted
- No "start here" guidance for new visitors
- No step-by-step onboarding
- Overwhelming for decision-making

### 5. **Limited Scannability**
- Long text blocks in some sections
- Bullet points would help
- No visual icons to break up sections
- Bottom sections may be missed (scroll fatigue)

---

## 📱 Device & Accessibility Review

### Desktop ✅
- Good layout, multiple columns work well
- Sufficient spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Tablet ⚠️
- 2-column layout might feel cramped
- Search form width management?
- Card sizes may need adjustment

### Mobile ⚠️
- Very long page (potential scroll fatigue)
- Form fields might be small
- CTA buttons need testing
- Need validation for usability

### Accessibility
- ❌ Need to verify color contrast (WCAG AA)
- ❌ Heading hierarchy unclear (H1, H2, H3 proper usage?)
- ❌ Alt text on images/logos?
- ❌ Keyboard navigation tested?
- ❌ Screen reader compatibility?

---

## 🔍 Competitive Positioning

### What's Missing vs. Competitors?
1. **No pricing clarity** - How much to post? How much do workers earn?
2. **No market stats** - How many active jobs/gigs right now?
3. **No differentiation** - Why Zintra vs other platforms?
4. **No mobile app mention** - Does Zintra have an app?
5. **No localization** - Kenya-specific benefits highlighted?

### What's Better?
✅ Dual user journey (workers + employers on same page)
✅ Safety messaging visible
✅ Clear "how it works" sections
✅ Trust-focused design
