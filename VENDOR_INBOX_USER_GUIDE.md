### Q: Why can't I see the Inbox button?

### Q: Can I edit messages?
**A:** Not yet. But you can delete the conversation and start fresh if needed.

### Q: What happens when I archive?
**A:** The conversation is hidden from the main list, but you can see it again by switching to the "Archived" filter. Nothing is deleted.

### Q: What happens when I delete?
**A:** The conversation is **permanently removed** - you can't get it back. The admin still has a copy on their side, but you won't see it anymore.

### Q: Are files secure?
**A:** Yes, files are stored in secure cloud storage. Only you and the admin can access them.

### Q: Can I attach any type of file?
**A:** Yes! PDFs, images, documents, spreadsheets, etc. - anything you need to share.

### Q: Will I see messages from the past?
**A:** Yes! When you open a conversation, you see the entire message history, all the way back to the first message.
